i learned how assembly line works and how to use the move constructor and move assignment operator to move objects from one container to another.
I have revised many concept which I have used in workshop which I learn during the semester. I found this projects a little bit dissicult as compare
to other workshop. First of all, In this workshop some parts are already implemented we just have to complete our tasks to make the application fully 
produtive. This project gives me an exposer  of the industry , I mean  kind of team work.
