# StationManagementSystem
 
 In the 3rd semester of the Computer Programming at seneca college, I worked on a project called station management. We divided this project in main 3 parts and implemented functions step by step. While working on the project we got to know how to implement concepts which we learned throughout the semester, which is the best way to optimize our solution ans so on.
